# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

- FM24 Steam players: the Contract tab shows the contract start ("Signed"), transfer/loan listing and Listed since, and an editable Asking Price (-1/Not set = Unspecified). Transfer listed and Loan listed are editable. Common names are used for display (Emerson Royal, Vinícius Júnior). Transfer value is mapped but not yet shown on FM24. Witnessed on FM24's Contract and Transfer screens; editor writes of asking price and loan listing were confirmed in FM and undone.
- FM24 Steam: read the current game date (`fm.exe+0x631D5BC`, followed over four game days). Ages are now exact on FM24 (Heung-Min Son 30 on 5 Jul 2023, as FM shows, not 31), and transfer listing is enabled; an editor listing of Son showed "Transfer listed" in FM and Undo restored it.
- `scan_arrays --date DAY/YEAR` lists static date words for locating game clocks.
- Add `Tools/fm-research.py`, a read-only field-research helper for fm-debug: cross-version offset leads, multi-witness checks and scans, array surveys and value filters, plus headless-FM search, menu navigation and OCR of FM's screens.

### Fixes

- FM24 Steam: staff and human-manager headers show their current club instead of "Club: Unknown", read-only through the staff contract's team (Guardiola Man City, Emery Aston Villa, the test save's manager Tottenham; unemployed staff such as Postecoglou stay Unknown). Staff contract wage/expiry and nationality remain unmapped on FM24.

## 0.4.1 (prerelease)

### Fixes

- Identify FM releases from the game module's PE product metadata on Windows and Linux/Proton, using install names only as a fallback. FM24 reads `fm.exe`; FM26/FM27 read `game_plugin.dll` rather than the Unity executable's engine version. Recognise compact `FootballManager24` fallback names and report module/resource errors accurately. Preserve the existing compatibility fingerprint gate; recognised Epic installations now report that no schema is available instead of silently selecting Steam's.
- Record process-local build-detection diagnostics: discovered modules, PE product/file versions, resource/discovery errors, identification source, storefront hints and schema-selection outcome. Persist changed reports in a bounded rotating log on Windows and Linux, including unsupported processes skipped while another game is available; retain every candidate's error when none can be identified.

### Compatibility and diagnostics

- This is a detection/diagnostics update, not Epic support. Recognised Epic installs have no verified schema and are rejected; no memory offsets or write behaviour changed. FM27 Game Pass remains unverified.
- For a failed identification, include `%LOCALAPPDATA%\fm-editor\logs\game-detection.log` on Windows or `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/fm-editor/logs/game-detection.log` on Linux, plus `.1` if present. Review account names in paths before sharing. See [reporter instructions](docs/release-notes/0.4.1.md#requesting-a-retest).
- Native installers and Arch packages remained pinned to the verified 0.4.0 binaries while 0.4.1 was prepared. Use the 0.4.1 portable build for the diagnostic retest; do not use a 0.4.0 installer.

### Packaging

- Pin the 0.4.1 native packaging identity to the immutable `v0.4.1` application tag at commit `f678f0b9771c8d992cecef96281ead4ddff89e75` from successful build `42563692148`, with an independent packaging revision. No verified installer or package is claimed yet.

## 0.4.0 (prerelease)

### Features

- FM24 Steam: editable player **Weight** and **Traits (PPMs)**, verified in game on Kane, Maddison, Kulusevski and Udogie.
- FM24 Steam: editable player **Morale** (numeric 1–20), matched against all 24 Brighton players and written/undone live.
- FM24 Steam: staff **Judge Staff**, **Data Analysis** and **Sports Science** are now mapped and editable, verified on Jedinak, Guardiola and Ryan Mason.
- FM24 Steam: clubs show read-only **Wage Spend** (FM's "Currently spending", p/w) and **Next Min Budget** (next season's minimum guaranteed transfer budget).
- Add read-only two-player comparison: **Select for compare** on one profile, then **Compare with selected** on another. Named columns stay visible while scrolling, with coloured attributes, grouped sections and available age, CA/PA, wage and expiry context. Snapshots clear on save reload/reconnection. No season-statistics mappings or memory writes are added.
- FM27 Steam: staff **Role ratings** are shown again (read-only), checked against every employed staff member's job and FM's Preferred Jobs icons.
- FM27 Steam: staff profiles show **Languages**, **Coaching Licence** and preferred in/out-of-possession **Formations** (read-only); player profiles show **Languages**, in FM's order and level words.
- FM27 Steam: edit player and staff **first, last and common names** by picking an existing name from a search (names are shared records; the editor re-points the person and never changes a name's text). Verified in game, through Undo, and across Save As and reload.
- FM27 Steam: player **Asking Price** read and write verified in game (-1 = Unspecified).
- Player Overview: **Show potential attributes** previews estimated values read-only in the normal attribute categories, replacing the separate Positions & Traits projection list. Actual attributes and editing return when switched off; other Overview fields remain editable.
- Add structured **Change history** with entity/field identity, before/after values, UTC submission time, labelled write/Undo outcomes, filters and expandable per-write attempts. Undone/failed actions and audit-only closed sessions remain visible in memory; old-session write/navigation authority is invalidated.
- Treat facility mirror writes and one date-picker interaction as logical Undo actions. Track acknowledgements per physical write, report partial success and retry only the remaining confirmed Undo portions; keep unrelated controls separate.

### Fixes

- Keep player and manager overviews compact: shallow identity headers and independently stacked personal-detail/attribute columns bring attributes into view without shrinking text. Reflow columns on narrow windows; constrain long read-only values beside their labels, with full text on hover.
- Fit more player attribute columns at default window sizes; move Status below Identity and display morale numerically (1–20). Place manager Roles below Knowledge.
- FM24 Steam: the club **Transfer Budget** now reads and writes the value FM's finance screen shows (finance+0x7CC). The budget-record copy used before is not what FM displays, so edits to it did not show in game.
- Make player profile layouts use available space: independently stacked attribute cards reduce gaps and scrolling; **Positions & Traits** sizes the pitch to the profile viewport and places traits beside it on wide views, with readable stacked layouts on narrow screens. Keep the existing schema-backed numeric editing and Undo behaviour.
- FM27 Steam: favoured-club reasons read the right byte. **As a player** / **As a supporter** were wrong for some clubs (Mbappé's R. Madrid, Litmanen's Ajax).
- Remove redundant inline UI instructions and the inert contract-type Apply button. Keep concise units and scope caveats in labels/tooltips; Best XI development research remains in the UI guide rather than the planner.
- Distinguish ordinary writes refused before writing from attempted writes whose completion is unconfirmed. Do not imply an API failure restored game memory; retain visible errors and refresh the active record.
- Refuse queued ordinary writes after the worker observes a save unload or while a new attachment is still loading, before memory access; retain the existing per-write byte guard when ready.

### Documentation

- Prioritize nation, competition, award, official and stadium discovery/browsing in the roadmap, with read-only coverage first; mark reusable player templates as low priority.

### Packaging

- Pin the 0.4.0 native packaging identity to the immutable `v0.4.0` application tag at commit `52b5e810fa2f3559816b6799954278aa1640bf38` from successful build `41305419521`, with an independent packaging revision. No verified installer or package is claimed yet.

## 0.3.0 (prerelease)

### Features

- FM27 Steam player data: editable morale and transfer value; injuries with **Heal**; suspensions and holidays with **Lift ban**; other nationalities and favoured clubs; **Transfer listed** / **Loan listed** with the listing date; editable bonus and fee clauses. See the UI guide's "FM27 player data".
- Replace the Best XI and player-position grids with a shared striped, fully marked football pitch and vector shirt icons, readable position abbreviations and a distinct goalkeeper kit. Player familiarity retains its numeric edit controls; Best XI retains player links, fit/growth scores and narrow-window stacked depth cards.

### Safety

- Before every edit or Undo, the worker re-reads memory and refuses the write if it no longer matches what was read.

### Fixes

- FM27 Steam: ages use the in-game date instead of a fixed year, so a player born 8 Jul 1991 is 35 on 14 Jul 2026, not 36. Headers, search columns, age filters and sorting all use it. Other builds keep the previous year-based estimate.
- FM27: the club finance value previously shown as an editable "Spending Wage Budget" is FM's current wage total (incl. bonuses). It is now shown read-only as **Current Wage Total**, beside the read-only **Wage Budget**.
- Club search matches the full name as well as the short name ("Tottenham" finds Spurs).
- FM27: club headers show the club's nation (Spurs England, Swansea Wales) instead of "Unknown".
- Undo history survives FM adding or removing records while the game advances (FM27 added a staff member during one game day, which previously cleared Undo). The editor now treats a save as replaced only when its club objects move or the entity arrays become unreadable, so reloading a save still clears Undo.

## 0.2.0 (prerelease)

### Features

- Add a read-only **Best XI** planner: choose a lineup from your managed clubs or any selected club across five formations, with a minimum position familiarity, three ranked alternatives per slot, a **Room to grow** mode ranked by PA minus CA, and links to player profiles. Injuries, fitness, suspensions and registration are not checked. Contributed by Laurentiu-Andronache (#2).
- Add **Club ID** (exact current club) to player Advanced search and a **My clubs** filter covering the managed club, its reserve/B and youth squads, incoming loans and owned players loaned elsewhere. My clubs is FM27 Steam only. Contributed by Laurentiu-Andronache (#1).

### Safety

- Map FM27 Steam contract ownership (player -> contract -> team -> club) and club reserve-team vectors, verified against independently known loan and reserve-team witnesses; membership resolves by cached club identity, fails closed on incomplete data, and is rebuilt on Reload Save.
- FM27 Steam human-manager discovery requires the verified human-manager class and skips the platform-account placeholder, fixing a false match; Game Pass keeps the previous heuristic because its inherited class address is unverified.

### Distribution

- Add a per-user Windows installer with Start Menu/optional desktop shortcuts and uninstall support, plus an Arch/CachyOS `fm-editor-bin` package with declared dependencies and desktop/icon integration.
- Add native-package CI that verifies and wraps existing tagged portable binaries, tests installation/removal and settings preservation, and exports separate packaging source without moving the application tag or publishing a release.

## 0.1.0 (prerelease)

First portable Windows/Linux preview. Game/build coverage and verification limits
are described in the README and per-version memory-layout documentation.

### Usability

- Add real FM27 screenshots to the README for player profiles, player search and club facilities.
- Keep player position cells in a compact, evenly spaced formation instead of stretching across the panel; place Sweeper between DC and GK in the centre column.
- Leave the platform-account entry FM27 creates for your Steam profile ("(<account name>)") out of the staff list; it is not a person in the game world.
- Show staff job code 16 as "Manager", the title FM27 uses, instead of "Head Coach".
- Add calendar popups beside date inputs, with month/year navigation and explicit day selection through the existing undo-aware edit path.
- Show the attached version in the editor/window title while retaining worktree identity; simplify the connection block to avoid repeating the status bar's version/PID.
- Replace colour-dependent pitch toggles with explicit position checkboxes and per-position numeric familiarity minima; make Advanced Search resizable and scrollable with an always-reachable footer and Sweeper option.
- Retain the left sidebar with grouped Browse/Management destinations and a separate connection block; move Undo and Change history into the editing toolbar. Add bordered identity summaries and attribute sections.
- Align shared profile value boxes, including reputation, with a fixed-width label column and hover text for truncated labels; add a render-only alignment regression test.
- Standardize player, staff, human-manager and club identity headers, section presentation and attribute controls; adapt attribute layouts to narrower windows.
- Add related club-name links using existing schema chains/cached identities, and a ground-name shortcut to the club Stadium tab.
- Make Back/Forward history span entity types and search pages while retaining search filters.
- Standardize Name/UID-first search toolbars, reset actions, inclusive filter labels, numeric validation, result selection and keyboard navigation; add club sorting.
- Remove non-functional controls, unfinished tabs and empty placeholder result columns; label read-only sections explicitly.
- Document current workflows and remaining relationship support in [the UI guide](docs/ui-guide.md).

### Safety

- Select schemas per build (release + storefront) instead of per release. PC Game Pass installs are recognised by their GDK manifest or `XboxGames` / `WindowsApps` location and get their own schema; FM27 Game Pass starts as an unverified copy of the Steam schema with an uncalibrated hash, so it can attach for bring-up on Windows. The toolbar names the build ("FM27 Game Pass"), and fm-debug `attach_status` reports the storefront and the module path.
- An unreadable game module (e.g. under `WindowsApps`) now fails the version gate with the file error instead of a misleading hash mismatch; the gate reads only the first 64 KB of the module.
- `Tools/scan-arrays.sh` scans every writable, non-executable section from the module's PE section table instead of a fixed FM26 window, so it reaches the FM27 arrays and any build's relocated ones.

- Support several Football Manager versions open at once: the toolbar offers one attach button per running `fm.exe` with its version and PID, and the status bar names the attached game. The editor, the fm-debug MCP server and the diagnostic binaries each read through the schema of the process they attached to; the process-global "active version" is gone, so one attachment can no longer switch another's offsets.
- fm-debug `attach_status` reports every running game, follows the game the editor is attached to, and takes an optional `pid` to switch; `get_known_schema` now reports the attached game's schema. `Tools/dump-manager.sh` and `Tools/scan-arrays.sh` accept `--pid <n>`.

- Disable memory editing and Undo when read-only or awaiting acknowledgement; record undo entries only after successful writes.
- Correlate write responses with request IDs, report detached writes as failures, preserve failed undo for retry, reconcile local buffers and keep write errors visible.
- Clear stale-save undo addresses on reconnect; retain read-only detail snapshots and reject unrelated asynchronous detail responses.
- Reject unmapped/out-of-bounds trait writes, avoid invalid ticket-price clamping on render, and safely handle missing DOB/gender data.

### Editing

- FM24 players show international caps and goals, nationality, place of birth and club, and their contract wage, expiry, squad status and squad number (mapped from FM27€0 leads, confirmed against five players' real records; squad-number edit and undo checked in game on Cristian Romero).
- FM24 clubs: training and youth facilities were swapped, and the wage budget read a copy that can differ from FM's screen; both now match FM24's Club Info and Finances. FM24 staff show FM24's own attribute names (Mental, Level of Discipline).
- Player contracts are editable: wage, expiry, squad status (FM's selectable statuses only) and squad number, plus asking price; transfer listing stays read-only.
- Player height and appearance (ethnicity, skin tone, hair colour and length, FM27) are editable.
- Staff and human-manager contract wage and expiry, and club reputation, are editable.
- Dates keep FM's flag bits above the day-of-year when edited and display correctly when flags are set.

### Project

- Keep unregistered worktree directories and failed cleanup targets intact instead of force-deleting them; report incomplete post-merge cleanup explicitly.
- Remove the superseded GUI plan and old UI-session verification logs, and clarify that uncalibrated builds can attach without a fingerprint guard.
- Remove obsolete witness snapshots and their active references; retain field-specific mapping evidence in the per-version memory-layout documentation.
- Add read-only-permission GitHub Actions jobs for native Windows/Linux checks, release startup smoke tests and portable test-build artifacts, with matching source archives, build metadata and SHA-256 checksums. Automatic release publishing is not enabled.
- Expand the roadmap using FMLE26's advertised capability scope, distinguish existing foundations from follow-up work, and propose a distinct search-and-inspect UI direction. These are planning changes, not implemented features.
- Explicitly track removing active player-unhappiness concerns separately from morale/squad status, and add a first-release CI/packaging checklist to the roadmap.
- Consolidate project safety and verification rules in a harness-neutral AGENTS.md, move detailed procedures into docs/development.md, and archive the original GUI implementation plan rather than treating it as current tasks.
- Add a README and license the project under GPL-3.0-or-later.
- Remove one-off research scripts, the snapshot-analysis toolchain and unused diagnostic binaries; keep `scan_arrays` and `dump_manager`.
- Keep local agent and editor configuration out of the repository; `.mcp.json` is now a cross-platform example for the fm-debug MCP server.
- Make the MCP server crates ordinary dependencies (Cargo cannot select dependencies on `debug_assertions`); the server itself remains debug-only.
