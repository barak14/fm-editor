# FM24 Memory Layout

Mapped 2026-10-22 against a fresh FM24 save (day 0, 3 Jul 2023) under Proton.
The code is the source of truth (`src/fields/fm24/`); this file holds the
discovery context, witnesses and what is still unmapped.

## Module

FM24 has **no `game_plugin.dll`**. Game logic and every entity-array RVA live
in `fm.exe` itself (image base 0x140000000), so `gp_base` is the fm.exe base on
this version (`GameVersion::module_name`). The exe is wrapped (non-standard
sections `.arch`/`.xtls`/`.sxdata`, a 360 MB RWX `.arch`), so static analysis is
not useful; everything below came from live memory.

Under Proton FM24's `/proc/<pid>/comm` is `Main Thread`, not `fm.exe`; the
Linux backend also matches the basename of argv[0] (`S:\…\fm.exe`).

Version gate: `known_dll_hash` = hash of the first 64 KB of `fm.exe`.

## Entity arrays (RVA relative to fm.exe)

| Entity | Count | data / end | Object vtable | Stride |
|--------|-------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Players | 83,426 | 0x642EDD0 / 0x642EDD8 | fm.exe+0x5A4E958 | 0x3E8 |
| Staff | 33,835 | 0x642EDE8 / 0x642EDF0 | fm.exe+0x5A4C2E8 | 0x268 |
| Clubs | 36,725 | 0x642EF58 / 0x642EF60 | fm.exe+0x5A51F38 | 0x170 spacing |

Found by scanning fm.exe's writable sections for `(data, end)` pointer pairs,
then locating witness records in the heap (Guardiola by his personality bytes,
Kane by his UID) and finding which arrays point at them.

- 0x642EDB8 (116,856) points 0x28 into a different object type; not players.
- 0x642EDF0 (24,775) is a subset of the staff array.
- 0x642EF88 (36,498) is a strict subset of the club array.
- 99.8% of player-array entries carry the player vtable.

The stadium array root is not located; stadiums are reached per club through
the `home_stadium` sub-record, so `rva_stadium_base` is 0.

## Player (vs FM26)

- Positions + attributes keep the FM26 order shifted **+0xB8**: positions
  0x208..0x216, attributes 0x217..0x24C.
- Individually moved: home/current/world rep 0x1FA/0x1FC/0x1FE, CA/PA
  0x200/0x202, height 0x14E, UID 0x284, name FmString 0x2C0, name subs
  0x2D0/0x2D8, DOB 0x2BC, personality 0x2F0..0x2F7, club ptr 0x3B0.
- Names: 40% direct FmString, 59% first/last sub-records, 0.5% neither.
- Added 2026-10-30 from FM27€0's FM24 table (leads), each confirmed on Harry
  Kane, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kevin De Bruyne and Joe Ward against
  their real-world records:
  - International record, four u8 at 0x3DC..0x3DF: caps, U21 caps, goals,
    U21 goals (Kane 84/14/58/8, Messi 175/18/103/14, Ronaldo 200/10/123/3,
    De Bruyne 99/2/26/0). FM27 widens caps and goals to u16.
  - Nation pointer 0x2E8 (name FmString at nation+0x18): England, Argentina,
    Portugal, Belgium, England.
  - Birth city pointer 0x300 (name at city+0x18): London, Rosario (SF),
    Funchal, Ghent, Chelmsford.
  - Team pointer 0x130, club at team+0x30: FC Bayern, Inter Miami, Al-Nassr,
    Man City, Derby.
  - Contract pointer 0x340: wage i32 £/week +0x18, expiry +0x40, squad status
    +0x4C, squad number +0x55. Expiry and number match real contracts (Kane
    30 Jun 2027 #9, Messi 31 Dec 2025 #10, Ronaldo 30 Jun 2025 #7, De Bruyne
    30 Jun 2025 #17); squad status 1 (Star Player) for the four stars. Squad
    number edited and undone in game on Cristian Romero (#17, Tottenham).
    Wage values (Kane 361,779, Romero 175,000) are not yet checked in game.
- Leads read but not yet confirmed in game: condition u16 0x1F8 and sharpness
  u16 0x1F4 (0..10000), morale u16 0x25E, jadedness i16 0x1F6, weight u16
  0x14C (Kane 86, Messi 67, Ronaldo 84, De Bruyne 68, Ward 68), asking price i32
  0x1D4 (-1 = none), looks 0x309..0x30C, traits 0x368. Cristian Romero
  (Tottenham) is consistent with FM's condition popup: condition 10000 "Peak",
  sharpness 5100 "Needs match practice", jadedness -125 "Fresh" (one witness).

## Staff (vs FM26)

- FM24 names two attributes differently from FM26/FM27: the coaching
  attribute at 0x3D is "Mental" (FM26: Possession) and the mental attribute at
  0x1C is "Level of Discipline" (FM26: Authority). Mile Jedinak's FM24 profile
  (2026-10-30) shows Mental 12 and Level of Discipline 14, matching 0x3D = 60
  (encoded) and 0x1C = 14; his Judging Staff Ability 9 matches the FM27€0 lead
  0x4A = 46 (encoded), a first witness for that unmapped field.
- Attribute block (< 0x50) is FM26 **+8**. Seven fields disagree with the
  Guardiola witness at +8 and are left unmapped: judge staff, data analysis,
  sports science, versatility, business, interference, resources.
- Reps 0xD0/0xD2/0xD4, CA/PA 0xD6/0xD8 (4 earlier than FM26), staff ID 0x104,
  name 0x140, name subs 0x150/0x158, DOB 0x13C, personality 0x170 (unchanged),
  role-ratings ptr 0x1F8.

### Human manager

Last entry of the staff array (vtable fm.exe+0x5A6A318). Identity fields live
at `offset + 0x358` (FM26: 0x350): IDs, DOB, name subs, personality, role ptr.
Unlike FM26 the direct name FmString is null in both slots — the name comes
from the sub-records. Verified on the test save's human manager (role ratings Manager 20).

## Club (vs FM26)

- Top level identical: UID 0x0C, full/short name 0xC0/0xC8, index 0x08.
- Info sub-record (ptr +0x100) is FM26 **+8**: abbreviations 0x00/0x08/0x10,
  season tickets 0xC0, founded 0xD8, owner status 0xDE, social 0xF8,
  supporter % 0x106..0x10B, supporter attributes 0x114..0x119, facilities
  0x120..0x12D. Training is **0x120** and youth facilities **0x12B** (swapped
  until 2026-10-30): Arsenal reads 19 / 16 and FM24's Club Info shows "Superb
  training facilities" / "Excellent youth facilities", with junior coaching
  0x12C = 17 "Excellent" and youth recruitment 0x12D = 15 "Good" on the same
  screen. FM27 uses the same offsets.
- Finance (+0x150), budget (finance+0x48) and attendance (stadium-sub +0xB0,
  0x68/0x6C/0x70) unchanged. The wage budget is **finance+0x810** (i32 £/week),
  not budget+0x0C: Spurs' finance screen shows Wage Budget £3,421,987 p/w
  (+0x810), currently spending £3,271,987 (+0x81C) and next season's minimum
  guaranteed transfer budget £25.92M (+0x7D4 = 25,925,482). budget+0x0C read
  3,464,579 for Spurs and equals +0x810 for Arsenal, Barcelona and Derby.
  Transfer budget £5.7M is both budget+0x04 and finance+0x7CC. The average
  ticket price float is at both finance+0x18 (mapped) and +0x870.
- Home stadium: club+0x18 → [0] senior team → +0x78, same chain as FM26.
- Not mapped: gender (+0x161 holds 0/2/4/8/10/32, not FM26's 0/1), nickname
  (stadium-sub +0x90 is a short name here), team UID, training ground,
  stand types, reputation, nation.

## Stadium entity (stride 0xB0)

UID 0x0C, name 0x38, alt name 0x40, capacity/seated/used/all-seater/expansion
u32 0x6C/0x70/0x74/0x78/0x7C, owner club ptr 0x80, pitch length/width ×10
0x88/0x8A. Standing, environment, condition unmapped.
