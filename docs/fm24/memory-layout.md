# FM24 Memory Layout

Mapped 2026-10-22 against a fresh FM24 save (day 0, 3 Jul 2023) under Proton.
The code is the source of truth (`src/fields/fm24/`); this file holds the
discovery context, witnesses and what is still unmapped.

## Module

FM24 has **no `game_plugin.dll`**. Game logic and every entity-array RVA live
in `fm.exe` itself (image base 0x140000000), so `gp_base` is the fm.exe base on
this version (`GameVersion::module_name`). The exe is wrapped (non-standard
sections `.arch`/`.xtls`/`.sxdata`, a 360 MB RWX `.arch`), so static analysis is
not useful; everything below came from live memory.

Under Proton FM24's `/proc/<pid>/comm` is `Main Thread`, not `fm.exe`; the
Linux backend also matches the basename of argv[0] (`S:\…\fm.exe`).

Version gate: `known_dll_hash` = hash of the first 64 KB of `fm.exe`.

Release identification now reads the PE version resource before consulting the
install directory. Read-only file inspection on 2026-11-09 of the installed Steam
`fm.exe` found `ProductName = Football Manager 2024`, `FileVersion = 24.4.2`
and `ProductVersion = 24.4.2+2081827`. These identify the release/build, not
field-layout compatibility; the existing module fingerprint gate is unchanged.
No mappings or writes were tested by this metadata inspection. Epic metadata
and offsets remain unverified; recognised Epic installs have no schema and are
rejected rather than routed to Steam's layout.

## Entity arrays (RVA relative to fm.exe)

| Entity | Count | data / end | Object vtable | Stride |
|--------|-------|------------|---------------|--------|
| Players | 83,426 | 0x642EDD0 / 0x642EDD8 | fm.exe+0x5A4E958 | 0x3E8 |
| Staff | 33,835 | 0x642EDE8 / 0x642EDF0 | fm.exe+0x5A4C2E8 | 0x268 |
| Clubs | 36,725 | 0x642EF58 / 0x642EF60 | fm.exe+0x5A51F38 | 0x170 spacing |

Found by scanning fm.exe's writable sections for `(data, end)` pointer pairs,
then locating witness records in the heap (Guardiola by his personality bytes,
Kane by his UID) and finding which arrays point at them.

- 0x642EDB8 (116,856) points 0x28 into a different object type; not players.
- 0x642EDF0 (24,775) is a subset of the staff array.
- 0x642EF88 (36,498) is a strict subset of the club array.
- 99.8% of player-array entries carry the player vtable.

The stadium array root is not located; stadiums are reached per club through
the `home_stadium` sub-record, so `rva_stadium_base` is 0.

## Current game date

**`fm.exe+0x631D5BC`** (`rva_current_date`), a static DateDayYear: day of the
year with FM's flag bits above bit 8, then the year (as FM27). Found
2026-11-09 with `scan_arrays --date` on 24.4.2+2081827 Steam: two statics read
Mon 3 Jul 2023 (raw 0x07E71AB8 at 09:00); after one-day holidays only this one
followed FM's date, reading 185, 186 and 187/2023 on Tue 4, Wed 5 and Thu 6 Jul
(00:00, flag bits 0). `+0x642F458` kept 3 Jul (the game start date FM shows);
`+0x6356C90` read 184 and later 187 but skipped 185/186, so it is not the
clock.

The editor reads it on attach and each status poll. FM24 ages are now exact
(Heung-Min Son, born 8/7/1992: 30 on 5 Jul 2023, as FM shows; the old
birth-year estimate gave 31). It also enables transfer listing: the editor
listed Son on Wed 5 Jul (flags bit 0, code 5, listed date 5 Jul 2023) and FM
showed "Transfer listed"; Undo restored flag 0, code 0 and 1 Jan 1900 in
memory, and after the next game day FM showed "Transfer status not set".

## Player (vs FM26)

- Positions + attributes keep the FM26 order shifted **+0xB8**: positions
  0x208..0x216, attributes 0x217..0x24C.
- Individually moved: home/current/world rep 0x1FA/0x1FC/0x1FE, CA/PA
  0x200/0x202, height 0x14E, UID 0x284, name FmString 0x2C0, name subs
  0x2D0/0x2D8, DOB 0x2BC, personality 0x2F0..0x2F7, club ptr 0x3B0.
- Names: 40% direct FmString, 59% first/last sub-records, 0.5% neither.
- Added 2026-10-30 from FM27€0's FM24 table (leads), each confirmed on Harry
  Kane, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kevin De Bruyne and Joe Ward against
  their real-world records:
  - International record, four u8 at 0x3DC..0x3DF: caps, U21 caps, goals,
    U21 goals (Kane 84/14/58/8, Messi 175/18/103/14, Ronaldo 200/10/123/3,
    De Bruyne 99/2/26/0). FM27 widens caps and goals to u16.
  - Nation pointer 0x2E8 (name FmString at nation+0x18): England, Argentina,
    Portugal, Belgium, England.
  - Birth city pointer 0x300 (name at city+0x18): London, Rosario (SF),
    Funchal, Ghent, Chelmsford.
  - Team pointer 0x130, club at team+0x30: FC Bayern, Inter Miami, Al-Nassr,
    Man City, Derby.
  - Contract pointer 0x340: wage i32 £/week +0x18, expiry +0x40, squad status
    +0x4C, squad number +0x55. Expiry and number match real contracts (Kane
    30 Jun 2027 #9, Messi 31 Dec 2025 #10, Ronaldo 30 Jun 2025 #7, De Bruyne
    30 Jun 2025 #17); squad status 1 (Star Player) for the four stars. Squad
    number edited and undone in game on Cristian Romero (#17, Tottenham).
    Wage values (Kane 361,779, Romero 175,000) are not yet checked in game.
- Weight u16 kg **0x14C** (mapped 2026-11-01): Kane 86, Udogie 73 and
  Maddison 73 match FM's profile; edits Maddison 73 -> 80 and Kulusevski
  79 -> 84 showed 80 kg / 84 kg in FM, and Undo restored memory.
- Traits (PPMs) u64 bitmask **0x368**, bit = PPM ID - 1 as on FM26/FM27
  (mapped 2026-11-01). Kane 0x00000A0000080080 = Tries Killer Balls Often,
  Comes Deep To Get Ball, Gets Crowd Going, Tries Long Range Passes, exactly
  FM's list. Maddison 0x0000200000080100 = Shoots From Distance, Comes Deep To
  Get Ball (both in FM's list) and Hits Free Kicks With Power (not checked).
  Adding Shoots From Distance to Udogie (0x2000000000, Dives Into Tackles)
  showed both traits in FM; Undo restored memory.
- Morale level u8 1..20 at **0x25F** (mapped 2026-11-01), the FM26/FM27
  encoding one byte after the old 0x25E lead (0x25E reads 104..185 and is
  something else). All 24 Brighton players' bytes match the squad Dynamics
  view: 8 Fair, 10 Okay, 11 Fairly Good, 12 Quite Good, 13 Good, 14 Really
  Good, 15 Very Good, 16 Extremely Good, 17 Excellent, 18 Superb, 19
  Exceptional (levels 8 and 10..14 match FM27's names). Setting Jason Steele
  17 -> 10 showed "Okay" in FM's squad view at once; Undo showed "Excellent".
- Sharpness lead u16 **0x1F4** (0..10000), still unmapped because no build has
  a condition UI yet. Over Brighton's 24 players FM's squad sharpness icon
  steps with it: red "Lacking Sharpness" up to 5850 (3500 Moder/Undav/Dahoud,
  5850 Groß), orange "Maintaining Sharpness" at 6100 (Milner), yellow at 7400
  (Scherpen). FM shows only these bands, so no exact value can be read off
  screen. Kane's profile header ("Severely lacking in match sharpness" at
  5900) and Maddison's ("Needs match practice" at 5150) look like advice text,
  not the band.
- Other leads read but not confirmed in game: condition u16 0x1F8 (10000 for
  fit players; injured Moder 9321, Scherpen 9325), jadedness i16 0x1F6 (-125
  for most players, Scherpen 0), looks 0x309..0x30C. Cristian Romero
  (Tottenham) is consistent with FM's condition popup: condition 10000
  "Peak", sharpness 5100 "Needs match practice", jadedness -125 "Fresh" (one
  witness).
- Mapped 2026-11-09 (24.4.2+2081827 Steam, Tottenham test save, 3 Jul 2023),
  from FM27 leads checked with `Tools/fm-research.py` against FM24's own screens:
  - **Contract start** contract+**0x3C** (FM27's "signed" date; FM24's
    Contract tab calls it "Started"). 7/7: Son 23/7/2021, Romero 30/8/2022,
    Davies 25/7/2022, Dier 21/7/2020 (on loan at Bayern), Porro 1/7/2023,
    Kulusevski 17/6/2023, Maddison 28/6/2023.
  - **Listing** contract+**0x4F** flags, bit 0 transfer listed, bit 1 loan
    listed; contract+**0x50** code (5 when transfer listed); contract+**0x48**
    listed date (packed 1 Jan 1900 = 0x076C0001 when not listed). FM's
    Transfer Status shows "Transfer listed" for Hennessey, Sinclair, Heaton,
    Pearce and Brandon Austin (all flags bit 0, code 5) and "Available for
    loan" for Gelhardt and Angol (bit 1); 13 unlisted Spurs read 0. The
    listed date is the game date for listed players, but FM24 shows no
    listing date to compare it with. Turning on Austin's Loan listed in the
    editor made FM show "Available for loan"; Undo restored the byte.
  - **Asking price** i32 **0x1D4**, -1 = "Unspecified". Set through FM's
    Transfer Status: Son £0 → 0, £7.5M → 7,500,000; Romero £5M → 5,000,000;
    both reset to Unspecified → -1. An editor write of £12M on Oliver Skipp
    showed £12M in FM; Undo restored -1.
  - **Transfer value** i32 **0x1D0**, inside FM's displayed range for Kane
    (224,724,320 in £168M-£225M), Maddison, Son, Romero, Udogie and van de
    Ven. The player panel shows value only on builds with mapped player
    lists, so FM24 does not display it yet.
  - **Common name** pointer **0x2E0** (same sub-record as first/last name):
    Emerson Royal, Vinícius Júnior, Richarlison, as FM displays them; null for
    Harry Kane.
  - Still unmapped: wage at contract+0x18 matches 6/7 contract screens but
    reads 197,000 for Son where FM shows £195,000 (unexplained). Join-date
    candidates 0x1EC, 0x3C4 and contract+0x44 agree for most players (Son
    28/8/2015, Davies 23/7/2014) but FM24 shows no joined date, and Messi
    reads 15/7/2023 vs 3/7/2023 between them. FM's senior debuts (Son
    24/3/2010, Kane 15/1/2011, Davies 25/8/2012, Kulusevski 20/1/2019) are not
    in the player object; the FM27 debut lead 0x3C8 holds something else.
    FM27's previous-club lead lands on FM24's club pointer 0x3B0.

## Staff (vs FM26)

- FM24 names two attributes differently from FM26/FM27: the coaching
  attribute at 0x3D is "Mental" (FM26: Possession) and the mental attribute at
  0x1C is "Level of Discipline" (FM26: Authority). Mile Jedinak's FM24 profile
  (2026-10-30) shows Mental 12 and Level of Discipline 14, matching 0x3D = 60
  (encoded) and 0x1C = 14.
- Attribute block (< 0x50) is FM26 **+8**; 0x10..0x17 is a pointer. Judging
  Staff Ability 0x4A, Analysing Data 0x44 and Sports Science 0x47 (encoded,
  displayed = (raw + 2) / 5) were mapped 2026-11-01 against FM24's staff
  profile tabs: Jedinak 9 / 5 / 3 (raw 46 / 25 / 15), Guardiola 15 / 7 / 3
  (74 / 35 / 15). Setting Ryan Mason's Judging Staff Ability 10 -> 16 and
  Analysing Data 4 -> 12 showed 16 and 12 in FM; Undo restored memory. The
  earlier Guardiola "disagreement" did not reproduce on FM24's own screens.
- Hidden attributes FM does not display stay unmapped, with FM26+8 leads
  (Jedinak / Guardiola): versatility 0x43 = 55 / 15, business 0x19 = 10 / 14,
  interference 0x1E = 12 / 17, resources 0x23 = 8 / 1.
- Reps 0xD0/0xD2/0xD4, CA/PA 0xD6/0xD8 (4 earlier than FM26), staff ID 0x104,
  name 0x140, name subs 0x150/0x158, DOB 0x13C, personality 0x170 (unchanged),
  role-ratings ptr 0x1F8.
- **Current club** (read-only, mapped 2026-11-09 on 24.4.2+2081827 Steam):
  staff+**0x1C0** → employment (FM24's staff contract object) → +0x10 team →
  +0x30 club → full name FmString +0xC0; the team → club step matches FM24
  players. FM26 keeps this contract pointer at +0x1A8. The employment object's
  +0x08 points back at staff+0xF8, and it holds 2022/2025 dates for
  Guardiola, apparently contract start/end, not yet mapped. The schema
  names it `employment`, not `contract`, so the staff Contract editor stays off
  while FM24 staff wage/expiry are unmapped. Witnesses against FM's own staff
  search (Tottenham test save, 3 Jul 2023): Pep Guardiola "Manager - Man City"
  → Manchester City; Unai Emery "Manager - Aston Villa" → Aston Villa; Ange
  Postecoglou "Manager - Unemployed" → null pointer; the human manager
  (Tottenham's manager on FM's Home screen) → Tottenham Hotspur through the
  shifted slot below. All 33,835 staff: 19,214 resolve with the back-pointer,
  14,620 are null; the only other entry is the human manager read unshifted.
  staff+0x58 points to a list of dated team entries (its first entry also
  reaches the current team); it is undecoded and not used for the club.

### Human manager

Last entry of the staff array (vtable fm.exe+0x5A6A318). Identity fields live
at `offset + 0x358` (FM26: 0x350): IDs, DOB, name subs, personality, role ptr,
and the employment pointer (0x1C0 + 0x358).
Unlike FM26 the direct name FmString is null in both slots — the name comes
from the sub-records. Verified on the test save's human manager (role ratings Manager 20).

## Club (vs FM26)

- Top level identical: UID 0x0C, full/short name 0xC0/0xC8, index 0x08.
- Info sub-record (ptr +0x100) is FM26 **+8**: abbreviations 0x00/0x08/0x10,
  season tickets 0xC0, founded 0xD8, owner status 0xDE, social 0xF8,
  supporter % 0x106..0x10B, supporter attributes 0x114..0x119, facilities
  0x120..0x12D. Training is **0x120** and youth facilities **0x12B** (swapped
  until 2026-10-30): Arsenal reads 19 / 16 and FM24's Club Info shows "Superb
  training facilities" / "Excellent youth facilities", with junior coaching
  0x12C = 17 "Excellent" and youth recruitment 0x12D = 15 "Good" on the same
  screen. FM27 uses the same offsets.
- Finance (+0x150), budget (finance+0x48) and attendance (stadium-sub +0xB0,
  0x68/0x6C/0x70) unchanged. The wage budget is **finance+0x810** (i32 £/week),
  not budget+0x0C: Spurs' finance screen shows Wage Budget £3,421,987 p/w
  (+0x810), currently spending £3,271,987 (+0x81C) and next season's minimum
  guaranteed transfer budget £25.92M (+0x7D4 = 25,925,482). budget+0x0C read
  3,464,579 for Spurs and equals +0x810 for Arsenal, Barcelona and Derby.
  Transfer budget is **finance+0x7CC** (mapped 2026-11-01); budget+0x04 holds
  a copy that FM's finance screen does not read. With only finance+0x7CC
  changed, Spurs showed £15.7M / £8.0M and Brighton (second human manager,
  same save) £72.0M; Undo restored £5.7M and £69.5M on screen. Brighton's
  wage budget changed when De Zerbi left (finance+0x810 1,712,351, FM
  £1,712,350 p/w) while budget+0x0C stayed 1,731,413, so the budget
  sub-record copies go stale. Transfer remaining stays at budget+0x08 (FM24
  shows no separate figure to check it against). The average ticket price
  float is at both finance+0x18 (mapped) and +0x870.
- Read-only finance figures (mapped 2026-11-01): **Currently Spending**
  finance+0x81C and **Next Season Min Transfer Budget** finance+0x7D4. Spurs
  £3,271,987 / £25.92M and Brighton £1,543,870 / £34.75M on FM's Finances
  screen; memory 3,271,987 / 25,925,482 and 1,543,871 / 34,750,000 (Brighton's
  wage figures read £1 above FM's display). Shown, not edited: FM recomputes them.
- Home stadium: club+0x18 → [0] senior team → +0x78, same chain as FM26.
- Not mapped: gender (+0x161 holds 0/2/4/8/10/32, not FM26's 0/1), nickname
  (stadium-sub +0x90 is a short name here), team UID, training ground,
  stand types, reputation, nation.

## Stadium entity (stride 0xB0)

UID 0x0C, name 0x38, alt name 0x40, capacity/seated/used/all-seater/expansion

## Player lists (medical, ties, clauses)

Mapped 2026-11-09 on 24.4.2+2081827 Steam (Tottenham test save, 3 Jul 2023)
from FM27's layout (`FM24_PLAYER_LISTS`). Found with `fm-research.py path`
(Bentancur's record to the text "cruciate"), then checked on FM24's screens.

- **Medical** pointer player+**0xF8**, the same object as FM27: injuries
  vector +0x00 of pointers to 0x38-byte entries (type pointer +0x08, name
  FmString at type+0x20, start date +0x20, u16 durations +0x28/+0x2A),
  absences vector +0x18 of pointers to 0x20-byte entries (kind +0x05, start
  +0x10, u16 days +0x16; 0x19 ban, 0x1F holiday).
  - Injuries match Medical Centre > Current Injuries: Bentancur "damaged
    cruciate ligaments" injured 11/2/2023, Gil "a torn groin muscle", Whiteman
    "a broken ankle" and Sessegnon "a torn hamstring" all 3/7/2023.
  - The two durations always differ by 30 days. FM24 shows only an "Expected
    Return" between them (Bentancur 221/251 days, expected 2/10/2023), so the
    light/full training labels come from FM27 and are not separately witnessed
    here.
  - Holidays: van de Ven 27 Jun + 22 days and Skipp 1 Jun + 59, matching FM's
    "return on Wednesday 19th July 2023" and "Sunday 30th July 2023". Bans:
    Toney 16 May 2023 + 245 days and Lomónaco 10 May 2023 + 372, matching
    FM's Bans panel "until 16/1/2024" and "until 16/5/2024". Other kind codes
    (0x5, 0x6, 0xA, ...) exist and stay unlabelled.
  - **Null medical pointer = no medical history** (about 96% of players):
    Kane, Rodri and Guido Rodríguez read null and FM shows them with no
    injury, ban or holiday. FM24's layout sets `medical_null_is_empty`, so
    the editor shows "None" for them; an unreadable or invalid pointer still
    shows as unavailable. Over the whole array 1,233 absence lists and 1,702
    of 1,703 injuries parse; one injury has a 7,808-day duration and that
    player's list shows as unavailable.
- **Ties** pointer player+**0x2F8** (FM27 +0x300), FM27's 16-byte entries:
  Kane Republic of Ireland + Tottenham "Supporter", Kulusevski North
  Macedonia + Arsenal "Supporter", Son Tottenham "Player" (FM's Overview >
  Information). 78,716 tie lists parse; 4,303 are empty (null vector).
- **Clauses** vector contract+**0x60** (FM27 +0x68), 8-byte entries as FM27.
  Bonus types 0x20/0x21/0x22/0x26/0x27 as FM27; the relegation wage drop is
  type **0x0F** with the percent at +0x04 (FM27 0x05). Maddison £20,000 /
  £35,000 / £25,500 assist / £8,500 / 25% and Porro £20,000 / £35,000 /
  £20,000 clean sheet / £6,500 / 25% match FM's Contract Details. Son reads
  9,850 where FM shows an unused-substitute fee of £9,750, the same 1.0103
  ratio as his wage (197,000 vs £195,000), unexplained.

Live write/Undo (same session, editor builds of this branch):

- **Lift ban:** Jonathan Rivas (ban 1 Jul 2023 + 183 days, FM "until
  31/12/2023"). The editor set the days to 2; FM, showing his profile for the
  first time, read "French National (until 3/7/2023)". Undo restored 183, and
  after a game day FM showed "until 31/12/2023".
- **Heal:** Bentancur 251/221 days → 142/142 (elapsed). After a game day FM
  showed no injury. Undo restored 251/221 (the entry stays in the vector), and
  after the next day FM showed "Damaged cruciate ligaments, 3 to 4 months".
- **Clause:** Maddison appearance fee £20,000 → £77,000; FM's Contract
  Details showed £77,000 after a day. Undo restored 20,000, and FM showed
  £20,000 after the next day.
- **Transfer value is read-only on FM24:** an editor write of £55,000,000 to
  Ben Davies (0x1D0) was back at 21,870,000 after a game day and FM kept
  showing £21M-£26M. FM recalculates the value daily, so FM24's layout sets
  `transfer_value_editable` false. The Undo of that write was refused (memory
  had changed), which also blocks the older entries in the chronological Undo
  stack until the save is reloaded.
