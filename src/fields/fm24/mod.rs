//! FM24 per-version field tables. Mirrors `fields::fm26`: each sub-module
//! owns one entity type's `FIELDS` const slice and this module collects them
//! into the `FM24` `VersionedSchemas`.
//!
//! FM24 has no `game_plugin.dll` — the game logic and every entity-array RVA
//! live in `fm.exe` itself (image base 0x140000000), so `gp_base` is the
//! fm.exe base on this version (see `GameVersion::module_name`).

/// FM24 schema — mapped 2026-10-22 against a fresh save (3 Jul 2023).
///
/// RVAs are relative to the fm.exe base. Each `(data, end)` pair is a
/// std::vector of object pointers in fm.exe's writable data:
///
/// - players `0x642EDD0` — 83,426 entries, 99.8% carry the player vtable
///   (fm.exe+0x5A4E958); contains Harry Kane. The neighbouring 116,856-entry
///   pair at 0x642EDB8 points 0x28 into a different object type.
/// - staff `0x642EDE8` — 33,835 entries (staff vtable fm.exe+0x5A4C2E8),
///   human manager last. The 24,775-entry pair at 0x642EDF0 is a subset.
/// - clubs `0x642EF58` — 36,725 entries (club vtable fm.exe+0x5A51F38); the
///   36,498-entry pair at 0x642EF88 is a strict subset.
///
/// The stadium array root is not located; stadiums are reached per club via
/// the `home_stadium` sub-record, so `rva_stadium_base` stays 0.
