//! fm-editor — real-time memory editor for Football Manager 26 and 24.
//!
//! This library crate holds the shared code for the main editor binary
//! (`src/main.rs`) and the standalone dump/scan tools (`src/bin/*.rs`).
//! Everything that needs version-aware schemas, process attachment, or
//! field lookups lives here so it has exactly one implementation.
